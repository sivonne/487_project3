      <p id="section1">
        On a campus that hallmarks diversity, it might surprise some that among the vast departments at UNC-Chapel Hill, there is not an Asian-American Studies department.
        </br></br>
        While departments have been established for African-American, Latin-American and Indian-American studies, there is still no place for what Dr. Jennifer Ho calls the “invisible group.”
        </br></br>
        However, if you look at the demographics for Chapel Hill since 1980, the Asian population in the town has increased drastically, from 1.6 percent in 1980 to 11.9 percent in 2010.

      On October 1, Ho led a discussion with the Asian American Pacific Islander Working Group on campus. The purpose of the meeting was for Ho to offer strategies for introducing an Asian-American department to campus.
      </br></br>
      A professor in the English department and associate director for the UNC-Chapel Hill Institute for Art & Humanities, Ho has been heavily involved in Asian-American representation initiatives, often speaking on the topic in her literature courses and at conferences such as the East Coast Asian American Student Union (ECAASC).
      </br></br>
      She said in an interview that her interest stems from her own undergraduate Asian-American studies classes at UC-Santa Barbara.
      </br></br>
      At the meeting, Ho suggested that the students partner up and introduce themselves to faculty members across departments. She offered names of professors and faculty who would be ideal to reach.
      </p>
  </div>
    <!--continues text-->
    <p id="section3">
      “All we’re doing is trying to meet with each individual history department faculty member to let you know that this is something that we, undergraduate students, care about very deeply,” Ho said as a way to present the discussion to faculty. “I’m here to tell you that, if an Asian-American history class was offered-we could guarantee that it would be full.”
      </br></br>
      Ho suggested canvassing students on campus with tools like Google Forms to provide quantifiable records to interested faculty or administration.
      </p>

      <!--continues text-->
      <p id="section4">
        Some professors are already interested in the progress of this initiative.
      </br></br>

      “I think the students would really benefit from an Asian-American studies…curriculum, or program or department,” said Dr. Mark Crescenzi, chair of the political science department at UNC-Chapel Hill in an interview.
      </br></br>

      One way to get the administration’s attention, Crescenzi said, is to receive a sizeable private grant.
      </br></br>

      “The other thing that drives curriculum revision…are changes that are led by the students,” Crescenzi said. “The desire for courses.”
      </br></br>

      In an interview, Ho said there are three main ways to create a department. Most departments are made through student activism like this working group, but there are fewer instances in which the administration or faculty decide to establish a program, with or without student demand. However, those instances are rare.

      </p>
      <!--continues text-->
      <p id="section5">
        In fact, if a student was to search for Asian-American majors on the Collegeboard website, which lists 3,770 colleges, they would find 26 colleges total across the nation that offer such a program. If they were to further narrow the results to “the South,” they would find zero.

              “It [the lack of a department] mimics the lack of representation for Asian-American students, faculty and staff across the country. You're more likely to see a program like this on the West Coast. Because concentrations of populations of Asian-Americans are higher,” said Crescenzi.
              </br></br>
              This is partly reflected on the Collegeboard website, which shows the program is primarily offered at colleges in California, and others in Pennsylvania, Colorado, New York, Arizona, and Maryland.
              </br></br>
              Crescenzi also attended school on the West Coast, at UC-Irvine, “where we had this wonderful and thriving set of Asian American populations,” he said.

      <p id="section7">
      According to <a href="https://datausa.io/profile/cip/050206/ ">DATA USA </a>, the five universities in 2016 with the most graduates from Asian-American programs were: UC-Davis, UC-Irvine, UC-Los Angeles, San Francisco State University and State University of New York at Binghamton.
      </br></br>
      “So that was actually very formative for why I do what I do, because when the Tiananmen Square incident happened, there was a huge Chinese-American population, and we sort of rallied behind them.”

    Data USA also indicates that in 2016, students with Asian-American degrees were largely female (at 57.8 percent), and of Asian descent (at 77.4 percent).
    </br></br>
    “You’re not looking for this to be therapy,” Ho said for the students to emphasize when speaking to faculty. “These classes are just as important for non-Asian-American students to take as it is for Asian-American students…you believe an Asian-American historian will add intellectual value to the department.”
    </br></br>
    Ho also suggested pairing with students outside the group when speaking to faculty.
    </br></br>
    “We have a momentum and we don't want to lose it,” said Jennifer Yang, a student involved in the working group and past student of Heidi Kim, another Asian-American literature professor at UNC.
    </br></br>
    “Like Dr. Ho said earlier, it's very easy for the university to just wait out until the student leaders graduate and the concerns are kind of muddled and then lost within the community. And I think it's very hard to grab that momentum again. And so that's why I'm personally gripping onto this and hoping that.”
    </br></br>
    Yang’s not alone in that hope.
    </br></br>
    “It's probably this huge source of potential energy that's just lying beneath the surface,” said Crescenzi.
